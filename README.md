# Programming Exercise: Health-Program


In two schools A and B, two different health programs are considered. In one school milk is distributed and in another school milk is not distributed. Nutrition experts plan to take these two classes by checking the height, weight and age of the students and compare them with each other. Write a program that takes the number of students in each class plus their age, height, and weight information and stores each in a list and prints the average age, height, and weight of each class respectively on a separate line in the output (as float) and then print the class whose average height is higher in the output. (In the beginning, enter the number and information of class A, and then the information of class B. The output should also be printed in the order of the input information.) If the average height is the same, the class with a lower average weight will be printed. If the average height and weight are equal, the expression Same (exactly the same) will be printed in the output.
It is necessary to use class in solving the exercise.

Example input:
```
5
16 17 15 16 17
180 175 172 170 165
67 72 59 62 55
5
15 17 16 15 16
166 156 168 170 162
45 52 56 58 47
```

Example output:
```
16.2
172.4
63.0
15.8
164.4
